@entry{entrytype,
  name={entry type},
  description={an entry's identifying type, as specified by \atentryfmt{entry-type}.
  (Not to be confused with the glossary label, which is identified by 
  the \field{type} field.) When referenced in a resource option, the 
  leading \code{@} is typically omitted. The \emph{original} entry type
  refers to the entry type as specified in the \ext{bib} file. The
  \emph{actual} entry type may be different and will be the result 
  of a conversion via resource options such as \csopt{entry-type-aliases}.
  Although the \ext{bib} format is case-insensitive, references to the 
  entry type in resource options should typically be in \idx{lowercase}.}
